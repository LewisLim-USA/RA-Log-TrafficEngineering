# Personal Summary
## üîë Key Insights (to‚Äëdate)

1. **Regulatory Focus vs. Enforcement Gap**   Government bodies predominantly **want to quantify risk**, but **rarely enforce** corrective measures at scale. Our dataset can bridge this ‚Äúknowledge‚Äìaction‚Äù gap by showing *where* and *why* risky riding spikes.
2. **IoT‚ÄëDriven Personal Verification**   Low‚Äëcost sensor fusion (GPS‚ÄØ+‚ÄØIMU‚ÄØ+‚ÄØvision) is emerging as the **de‚Äëfacto method for behavioural verification**, surpassing self‚Äëreported surveys.
3. **Context‚ÄëAware Labelling > Generic Thresholds**   Speed or acceleration cut‚Äëoffs alone misclassify risk; integrating *road type*, *traffic density*, and *weather* produces richer insights.
4. **Mastering** different types of perception modules and reading through their manual is challenging like A7670SA vs SIM7000E
