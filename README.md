## üìë Project Overview, Learning from the experts

This repository documents the end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflow and weekly reflections for the **‚ÄúQuantification of Motorcyclist Risky Behavior Using a Naturalistic Driving Study Approach‚Äù** research assistantship (March‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØMay‚ÄØ2025). The study captures real‚Äëworld ride data with an IoT sensor stack (GPS, IMU, video, CAN, and environmental probes) to identify patterns that correlate with risky maneuvers on Malaysian roads.

## üîë Key Insights (to‚Äëdate)

1. **Regulatory Focus vs. Enforcement Gap**   Government bodies predominantly **want to quantify risk**, but **rarely enforce** corrective measures at scale. Our dataset can bridge this ‚Äúknowledge‚Äìaction‚Äù gap by showing *where* and *why* risky riding spikes.
2. **IoT‚ÄëDriven Personal Verification**   Low‚Äëcost sensor fusion (GPS‚ÄØ+‚ÄØIMU‚ÄØ+‚ÄØvision) is emerging as the **de‚Äëfacto method for behavioural verification**, surpassing self‚Äëreported surveys.
3. **Edge Processing Matters**   Early feature extraction on Raspberry‚ÄØPi‚ÄØ5 significantly reduces storage overhead and protects rider privacy by discarding raw video off‚Äëdevice when not required.
4. **Context‚ÄëAware Labelling > Generic Thresholds**   Speed or acceleration cut‚Äëoffs alone misclassify risk; integrating *road type*, *traffic density*, and *weather* produces richer insights.
5. **Mastering** different types of perception modules and reading through their manual is challenging like A7670SA vs SIM7000E
